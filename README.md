# Cat Eleventy Starter
A template with...
- **YAML** & **SASS/SCSS** (including importing from `node_modules`) support
- Automatic **cache busting** using [eleventy-auto-cache-buster](https://github.com/Denperidge/eleventy-auto-cache-buster)
- Directory structure with `src/` and `dist/`
- Base template which has a **skip-link**, allows for custom title & page specific stylesheet imports
- **Favicon** generation
- **OpenGraph** support
- **Normalize.css** imported by default
- Templates extending **base template** into page.md & page.pug, which when used get automatically added in the **nav**
- Classes from the accessibility section in [my helpers repo](https://github.com/Denperidge/helpers) built-in
